# Find the Transit â€” Exoplanet Mini-Game

**Find the Transit** is a fun + educational browser-based game where players try to spot the dip of an exoplanet transit hidden in a noisy, simulated light curve.

ðŸŒŒ Built to give NASA Exoplanet Watch community members (and anyone interested in exoplanets) a taste of what real light curve analysis feels like â€” without needing specialized software.

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Play
1. Adjust the **Difficulty**, **Transit Depth**, and **Duration** sliders to set your challenge.
2. Click **New Curve** to generate a random simulated light curve.
3. **Click and drag** over the section where you think the transit occurs.
4. Press **Score Guess** to see how close you were.
5. Hit **Reveal** to view the true transit window.

## ðŸ§® Features
- Adjustable noise level, depth, and duration for replayability.
- Optional slow atmospheric drift and occasional outliers.
